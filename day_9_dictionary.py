#Instructions
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the
# values are their exam scores.
#
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary
# called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
#
# DO NOT modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary.
#
# DO NOT write any print statements.
#
# This is the scoring criteria:
#
# Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
#
# Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
#
# Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
#
# Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
#
# Expected Output
# '{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
# Hint
# Remember that looping through a Dictionary will only give you the keys and not the values.
#
# If in doubt as to why your code is not doing what you expected, you can always print out the intermediate values.
#
# At the end of your program, the print statement will show the final student_scores dictionary, do not change this.

# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.
#
# Write a function that will work with the following line of code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.
#
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# You've visited Russia 2 times.
#
# You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
#
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a function that modifies it.
#
# Hint
# Look at the function call above to see what the name of the function should be.
#
# The inputs for the function are positional arguments. The order is very important.
#
# Feel free to choose your own parameter names.

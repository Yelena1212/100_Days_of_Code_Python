# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:
#
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE
#
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#
# on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#
# **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#
# **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400
#
# e.g. The year 2000:
#
# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
#
# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
#
# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
#
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
#
# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
#
# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
#
# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
#
# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
#
# To work out the love score between two people:
#
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
#
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
#
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
#
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#
# "Your score is **z**."
# e.g.
#
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
#
# R occurs 1 time
#
# U occurs 2 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 5
#
# L occurs 1 time
#
# O occurs 0 times
#
# V occurs 0 times

# E occurs 2 times

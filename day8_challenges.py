# Instructions
# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
# Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.
#
# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.
#
# e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
#
# number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5 = 1.6
#
# But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
#
# IMPORTANT: Notice the name of the function and parameters must match those on line 13 for the code to work.
#
# Example Input
# test_h = 3
# test_w = 9
# Example Output
# You'll need 6 cans of paint.

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
import math

def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
    number_of_cans = math.ceil((height * width) / cover)
    print(f"You'll need {number_of_cans} cans of paint.")

#Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
# Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
paint_calc(height=test_h, width=test_w, cover=coverage)

# Instructions
# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number
#
# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.
# e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.
# But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
def prime_checker(number):
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, number):
        if number % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
    if is_prime:
        print("It's a prime number")
    else:
        print("It's not a prime number")


# Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†

# Do NOT change any of the code belowðŸ‘‡
